Summary
===
- Designed and implemented a digital control system for a BLDCM on a CPLD development board (ispLSI1016), incorporating VHDL for programming logic.
- Designed the switching circuit, half-bridge power transistor driver, and the pulse-wide-modulation (PWM) signal generation circuit, and configured three-phase Hall sensors.
- Prototyped the entire system on a PCB, tested it experimentally, and verified the realization of the desirable functions.
