Research Approach  
===  

- Utilized Unity3D to develop VR game environments, focusing on interactivity, complex scene construction, and narrative-driven puzzle gameplay. 
- Implemented VR interaction systems including animation triggers, user interface (UI) design, and collider triggers to boost interactivity and immersion.
- Ensured smooth VR hardware integration with VR headsets and hand controllers.
