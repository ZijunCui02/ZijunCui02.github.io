Research Approach   
===

  
- 参与introduce a novel physics-constrained planner, which learns the time fields and execute motion planning for robots of various shapes from any start state to any goal state in a self-supervised manner.
- Utilized/ Proposed several physical constraints to enable the network to jump out of local minima and converge to the correct solutions that obey the physical rules.
- We develop a new neural shape-aware distance field for collision checking that can predict the minimum distance to the environment for any robot with arbitrary shapes and configurations in the fixed environment, which facilitates both self-supervised training and test stages.
- Participated in composing a conference paper (in 修改).
