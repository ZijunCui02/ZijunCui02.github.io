# Infinite Liberty - A VR Puzzle Narrative

## Story Overview
**Infinite Liberty** is a Virtual Reality (VR) puzzle game that combines fragmented narrative storytelling with light puzzle-solving elements. Players step into the shoes of a woman who wakes up in a seemingly abandoned spacecraft and gradually uncovers a mysterious story involving her and her husband.

## Background
You wake up in what seems to be an abandoned space capsule, confused and disoriented. The silence is eerie, broken only by the subtle hum of the capsule's machinery. Your husband is nowhere to be found, but you discover his diary in the chamber.

## Story Progression
- **Exploring the Capsule**: You begin to explore the capsule to find clues. This involves solving a series of puzzles, such as operating various devices, cracking codes, and mechanical setups.
- **Discovering the Diary**: Through the diary, you learn that your husband may have harbored malevolent intentions towards you, mentioning a mystery involving a book and a deadly plan.
- **Dynamic Interactions**: As you explore, you will interact with various objects in the capsule, including doors, books, radios, and other devices. These interactions often involve puzzle-solving that advances the story.

## Conflict and Climax
- **Husband’s Disappearance**: You uncover a series of clues suggesting that your husband might have been murdered. Using a crowbar found, you open a door to another part of the capsule.
- **Revealing the Truth**: In the new area of the capsule, you find more diary pages and your husband’s belongings that reveal a larger conspiracy. You realize that you might not just be an innocent victim.
- **Inner Conflict**: In the final puzzle and interactive animation, you confront your past and the darker sides of yourself. You ultimately discover that the deadly mystery is deeply connected to you.

## Conclusion
- **Self-Discovery**: After a series of shocks and introspection, you find a way to leave the space capsule, but in the process, you also uncover your true identity and the truth about your husband's death.
- **Choosing Freedom**: The game offers multiple endings, depending on the player's choices, you can choose to reveal the truth and seek redemption, or continue to dwell in the shadows of the past. Each choice comes with different ending animations and plot outcomes.

## Technical Implementation
- **VR Interactions**: The game's interactive design fully utilizes virtual reality technology, including animation triggers, collision detection, and UI design, to provide an immersive gameplay experience.
- **Music and Sound Effects**: The ambiance of the game is further enhanced by captivating background music and realistic sound effects, deepening the player's emotional engagement.
