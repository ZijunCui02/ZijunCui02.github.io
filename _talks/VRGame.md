Abstract
===  

- <p style = "text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;"> Utilized Unity3D to develop VR game environments, focusing on interactivity, complex scene construction, and narrative-driven puzzle gameplay.</p>
- <p style = "text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;"> Implemented VR interaction systems including animation triggers, user interface (UI) design, and collider triggers to boost interactivity and immersion.
Ensured smooth VR hardware integration with VR headsets and hand controllers.</p>
