Research Approach
===

- Designed the half-bridge power transistor driver and pulse-wide-modulation (PWM) signal generation circuit and configured three-phase Hall sensors.
- Designed and implemented a digital control system for the power electronic circuits on a CPLD development board (ispLSI1016), incorporating VHDL for programming logic.
- Prototyped the entire system on a PCB, tested it experimentally, and verified the realization of the expected functions.
- Designed and compared various starting, driving, and speed control strategies for the Brushless DC Motor (BLDCM).
