Summary  
===

  
- Proposed the current compensation algorithm and the current transformer, targeting high-accuracy measurements, robust protection, and digital output.
- Programmed magnetic hysteresis fitting and current compensation algorithms using a Keil 4 microprocessor in C and implemented data processing on STM32 microcontrollers.
- Conducted Simulink simulations and system-level optimizations, significantly improving current measurement accuracy.
- Completed the hardware prototype for current measurement in practical power converters, which verified the functionality of the compensation algorithm in improving the accuracy of current transformer.
- Authored a comprehensive project paper on the project, which was highly commended in the final evaluation.
