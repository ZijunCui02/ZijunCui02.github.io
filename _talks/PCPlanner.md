Abstract
===  

- <p style = "text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;"> Contributed to the development of a novel physics-constrained planner that learns the time fields and execute motion planning for robots of various shapes from any start state to any goal state in a self-supervised manner.</p>
- <p style = "text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;"> Implemented several physical constraints to enable the neural network to overcome local minima and converge on solutions that adhere to physical laws.</p>
- <p style = "text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;"> Assisted in creating a neural shape-aware distance field for collision checking, accurately predicting the minimum distance to the environment for robots with arbitrary shapes and configurations, thereby enhancing both self-supervised training and testing phases.</p>
